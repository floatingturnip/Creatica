# Creatica

## Set up

To work on this project, first you need [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) (required).
You will also need either Git Bash (comes with Git) or [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). If you are unfamiliar with git commandes it may be more intuitive to start off with Github Desktop

You will also need [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (should already come with python)
and a text editor or IDE of your choice. I recommend [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

To clone the repository click on the green button at the top and either open it with Github Desktop or in a command terminal, in your desired folder run `git clone https://github.com/floatingturnip/Creatica.git`

After cloning the repository, set up a virtual environment, if using Pycharm you can follow these [instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html)
otherwise follow these [instructions](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

Once your virtual environment is activated run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run the app
Now in your terminal if you type `python app.py` you should be able to run it
