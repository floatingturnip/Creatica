# Creatica

## Set up

To work on this project, first you need [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) (required).
It may be more intuitive to work with [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (optional)

You will also need [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (should already come with python)
and a text editor or IDE of your choice. I recommend [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

After cloning the repository, set up a virtual environment, if using Pycharm you can follow these [instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html)
otherwise follow these [instructions](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

Once your virtual environment is activated run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run the app
Now in your terminal if you type `python app.py` you should be able to run it
